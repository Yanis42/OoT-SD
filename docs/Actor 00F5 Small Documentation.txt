Object: 0001
Actor: 00F5

Variables:
0x0000 Nothing
0x0001 Weird lightning, seems to be used only in cutscenes
0x0002 White Particles who go in center, seems to be an npc according to GZ
0x0003 Weird red ball
0x0004 Weird green ball
0x0005 Weird yellow ball
0x0006 Weird purple ball
0x0007 Weird orange ball
0x0008 Weird blue ball
0x0009 Weird red ball who rocket away
0x000A same as 0x0009 except it's blue
0x000B Seems to be that orange effect after Nabooru Knuckle fight cutscene
0x000C I think it's Ganondorf's magic ball in the cutscene where we got OoT
0x000D Might be spawned by 0x000C, particles following Link?
0x000E ? 
0x000F ?
0x0010 ?
0x0011 ?
0x0012 ?
0x0013 ?
0x0014 and more seemed to crash the game, maybe due to the practice rom

Notes:
0x0001 and 0x0002: might be spawned for the cutscene just before Ganondorf's dialogue in void realm
0x0003 to 0x0008: should be the balls before 0x0001 and 0x0002 are used
0x000E to 0x00013: I think it's the effect after the balls disappear but before 0x0001 & 0x002 are used
0x0009, 0x000A and 0x000B: effects during post-Nabooru knuckle fight
